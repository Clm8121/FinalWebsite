      </div>
      <div class="introduction">
        <p class="indent">As we all know, social media is a great way to stay connected with the world and share information.  The transition of printed news, television, and radio to digital spaces has caused a huge disruption in the traditional news industry.  Americans are getting a large majority of the news from digital devices. While inaccurate information has always floated around this type of platform, it seems to have a noticeable pike in it between 2016 through 2022. Between these times were agendas concerning presidential elections and candidates, Covid-19, and global issues concerning war and the environment.  While there was much more, these topics sparked a severe amount of damaging false information.  Unlike the News, social media sites don’t have the same regulations across all. This leads to a lot of unfacted-checked information surfing through tweets, posts and videos, and comments.</p>

        <h3>Tiktok [TW: Briefly mentions SI, SH, and ED]:</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="indent">Tiktok has very in-depth Community Guidelines.  There are thirteen subsections that range from “Minor Safety”, “Suicide, Self-harm, and Disordered Eating”, “Nudity and Sexual Activities”, and “Copyright and Trademark Infringement” but nothing that states misinformation or disinformation.  In Tiktok’s “Introduction” to the Community Guidelines, they state that “[they] will remove any content – including video, audio, live stream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates [their] Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of [their] decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. [They] will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; [they] may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.</p>

        <p class="indent">After reading through each section of their thirteen subsections, as of early December 2022, there was no explanation of punishment for sharing false information.  However, Tiktok states that they “take a firm stance against” enabling violent extremism and sexual activities since this platform is for thirteen-year-olds and older. </p>

        <p class="indent">If you have been on Tiktok even for a brief moment, you understand how inaccurate this is. Tiktok is known to selectively shadow-banned (not putting the creator’s videos on the “For You Page” but not outright banning the creator) people of color, activists, and LGBTQ+ people; especially the trans community.  A prime example of this is when the Black Lives Matter protests were happening in 2021 and early 2022. Creators that documented the events showed up on everyone's FYP no matter what your algorithm was normally.  These creators did not just suddenly start because of the current events; they were always posting, but now Tiktok felt it was the right time to unshadow ban them.  After the peak of those events slowed down, Tiktok re-shadow banned the creators.</p>

        <p class="indent">As more the “firm stance against” sexual activities, Tiktok is turning into a softcore pornography site. These men and boys, but it is predominantly woman roleplay as young girls posting “thirst traps” that allude to sexual activities. However, the problem runs that there is a pattern of only white, beautiful women that are shown and never a minority.  When a person of color or a person from the LGBTQ+ community partakes in these videos, they are immediately banned or flagged.</p>

        <p class="indent">It seems that Tiktok does not follow its own guidelines and is missing a few important ones.  However, even if they did have consequences for posting false information, they probably would not take action against the accounts unless the creators fit a certain category.</p>
