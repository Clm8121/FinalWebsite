      <div class="introduction">
        <p class="indent">As we all know, social media is a great way to stay connected with the world and share information.  The transition of printed news, television, and radio to digital spaces has caused a huge disruption in the traditional news industry.  Americans are getting a large majority of the news from digital devices. While inaccurate information has always floated around this type of platform, it seems to have a noticeable pike in it between 2016 through 2022. Between these times were agendas concerning presidential elections and candidates, Covid-19, and global issues concerning war and the environment.  While there was much more, these topics sparked a severe amount of damaging false information.  Unlike the News, social media sites don’t have the same regulations across all. This leads to a lot of unfacted-checked information surfing through tweets, posts and videos, and comments.</p>

        <h3>Twitter:</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="indent">On Twitter Code of Conduct, they state that “depending on the potential for offline harm [of false information], we limit amplification of misleading content or remove it from Twitter if offline consequences could be immediate and severe.” Twitter also states that “people who repeatedly violate our policies may be subject to temporary suspensions'' and was even known to delete accounts and ban people off their site.  Reasons for people getting banned between 2016 and 2022 was about the spread of false information on who won the 2020 election, Covid-19, and outright promoting hate crimes toward others.  To name a few people who are currently banned or suspended are as follows:</p>

        <div class="peopleList">
          <div class="peopleHeading">
            <h3>People Who got Banned or Suspended by Violating Rules:</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="peopleNames">
            <p><span class="bold">Marjorie Taylor Greene: </span>Suspended due to repeated violation of Twitter's Covid-19 disinformation policy.</p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="bold">Mike Lindell: </span>Permanently banned due to perpetuating the claim that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.</p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="bold">Aubrey Huff: </span>Permanently banned due to violation of Twitter’s Covid-19 misinformation policy.</p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="bold">Sidney Powell (and main other high-profile supporter of Donald Trump): </span>Permanently banned due to promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.</p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="bold">Donald Trump: </span>Permanently Suspended due to false information about Covid-19, “the risk of further incitement of violence” after the January 6th, 2021 insurrection at the U.S Capitol for those who didn’t support his cause, false information about the 2020 election, and much more.</p>
          </div>
          </div>
        <br>
        <p class="indent">The people above have much in common with spreading false information, hate crimes, and yes, being more conservative-leaning.  But this does not mean that conservative voices are being silenced, in fact, quite the opposite as there was a legitimate reason for their punishments.  Twitter has been known to delete accounts belonging to liberal-leaning for little to no explanation as to why.  The common characteristics these accounts share are that they are owned by people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, allied people, and liberal-leaning who speak out against the current owner of Twitter and the problems in the country.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="peopleHeading">
          <h3>People Who got Banned or Suspended with no Explanation:</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="peopleNames">
          <p><span class="bold">Dean Baker (a left-leaning economist who co-founded the Center for Economic and Policy Research): </span>Suspended due to “spam” after criticizing Elon Musk. (However, was reinstated the next day after Twitter realized they had no grounds for the suspension).</p>
          <br>
          <p><span class="bold">Andrew Lawrence (a senior researcher at Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog group): </span>Suspended due to “spam” after a prominent critic of Elon Musk running Twitter.  (However, was reinstated the next day after Twitter realized they had no grounds for the suspension).</p>
          <br>
          <p><span class="bold">Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club (Twitter group that promoted and assisted in marginalized communities (Including LGBTQ+) about defense against white supremacy and fascism): </span>Suspended.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span class="bold">Chad Loder (antifascist researcher whose open-source investigation of the U.S. Capitol riot led to the identification and arrest of a masked Proud Boy who attacked police officers): </span> Suspended.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span class="bold">Vishal Pratap Singh (Video journalist who reports on far-right protest in Southern California): </span>Suspended.</p>
        </div>
          <br>
          <p class="indent">Twitter just recently, as of April 14, 2022, came over new ownership by Elon Musk.  While we currently are not sure how he will change Twitter regulations, we do know he is looking over who is banned or suspended from Twitter and reversing the consequences on predominantly Trump-supporting and conservative-leaning accounts.  Again, most of their accounts were banned or suspended by repeating sharing disinformation, homophobia, and racial hate crime vocabulary, and sharing fascist ideology. Elon has stated that he is against permanent banns and favors more tailored punishments for content that is illegal or otherwise “destructive to the world.” </p>
