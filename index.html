        <p class="disclaimerContent">The purpose of this website is to help people understand that everything on the internet is not true and should be researched further before sharing. This website does not put others down who happen to accidentally spread misinformation,
        but for those to take accountability by doing better next time around, and realizing how damaging it can be.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between “Misinformation” and “Disinformation?”</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="indent">Misinformation is when someone unknowingly shares false or inaccurate information. Disinformation is when someone deliberately spreads incorrect information knowing that it is inaccurate. These two kinds of false information are spread
        globally on the internet through platforms like but not limited to the news, social media, and entertainment like movies and television shows. It is important that people take given information lightly and do further research before sharing
        their findings. There are many reasons why people spread false information, and most have to do with a lack of unbiased research. When something is “unbiased” it means it has no prejudiced agenda and is imperial; in other words: neutral and
        factual.</p>

        <p class="indent"> As of 2021, more than 80% of people get their news from digital devices in the United States. Meaning fewer people are using newspapers and more are using digital platforms. Newspapers have to go through much more fact-checking and
        articles online due to the convenience of editing. However, this can also be seen as a plus since information online can be updated with better fact-checking if something changes in accuracy. Many people also get their information from
        their trusted family and friends. No one believes that their loved ones would intentionally lie to them; and if you think they would, you need to surround yourself with better people. Many trusts what close ones have to say, which can cause
        a lot of initial spread of misinformation.</p>

        <p class="indent">Whether you get your news and information from a physical paper, a digital platform, or a loved one, you should always be fact-checking on your own. By doing this, you are not only better educating yourself, but you are also lowering the
        chance to spread misinformation.</p>
