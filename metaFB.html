      <div class="introduction">
        <p class="indent">As we all know, social media is a great way to stay connected with the world and share information.  The transition of printed news, television, and radio to digital spaces has caused a huge disruption in the traditional news industry.  Americans are getting a large majority of the news from digital devices. While inaccurate information has always floated around this type of platform, it seems to have a noticeable pike in it between 2016 through 2022. Between these times were agendas concerning presidential elections and candidates, Covid-19, and global issues concerning war and the environment.  While there was much more, these topics sparked a severe amount of damaging false information.  Unlike the News, social media sites don’t have the same regulations across all. This leads to a lot of unfacted-checked information surfing through tweets, posts and videos, and comments.</p>

        <h3>Meta (Facebook):</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="indent">Meta’s policy rationale begins with the statement that when it comes to “graphic violence or hate speech, for instance, our policies specify the speech we prohibit, and even persons who disagree with those policies can follow them. With misinformation, however, we cannot provide such a line. The world is changing constantly, and what is true one minute may not be true the next minute. People also have different levels of information about the world around them and may believe something is true when it is not. A policy that simply prohibits “misinformation” would not provide useful notice to the people who use our services and would be unenforceable, as we don’t have perfect access to information.”</p>

        <p class="indent">While there is the fact that not everyone has equal access to the internet, those who post on Meta do.  Those who use the internet to connect to Meta also have access to Google, News articles, and much more to fact-check the information they are spreading. When Meta was called “Facebook”, it was notoriously known for the spread of false information.  Since there is no outright punishment and direct definitions of what is false information, people posted whatever they found and continued the spread. There is the argument that Meta is holding as to why they cannot hold consequences due to information changing constantly, which is correct.  A user should not be held accountable for sharing accurate information that is now outdated.  This is why it is up to us, the audience, to take note of when information was posted.</p>

        <p class="indent">It is easy to search for an answer or data and just roll with the first link we find. However, it is our responsibility to look up when this information was dated and do further research if we are suspicious of the past date.  Personally, I like to stick with the 1 week range. If the information I find is more than a week old, I try to reword my search and find newer information.  If newer information isn’t found, it is a safe guess that the original link is still up-to-date.</p>
