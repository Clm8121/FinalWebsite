      <div class="introduction">
        <p class="indent">Fact-checking information is a great way to help minimize the spread of false information.  By doing so you better educate yourself and others around you while you make informed decisions on where you processed to get information.  Below are some sites that are reliable or do fact-checking.</p>

        <div class="subHeading2">
          <h3><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/about/">Pew Research Center</a>:</h3>
        </div>
          <p class="indent">“Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes, and trends shaping the world. [They] conduct public opinion polling, demographic research, content analysis, and other data-driven social science research. We do not take policy positions. [They] generate a foundation of facts that enriches the public dialogue and supports sound decision-making. [They] are nonprofit, nonpartisan, and nonadvocacy. [They] value independence, objectivity, accuracy, rigor, humility, transparency and innovation.”</p>
        <div class="subHeading2">
          <h3><a href="https://www.politifact.com/">PolitiFact</a>:</h3>
        </div>
          <p class="indent">“Fact-checking journalism is the heart of PolitiFact. [Their] core principles are independence, transparency, fairness, thorough reporting, and clear writing. The reason [they] publish is to give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a democracy. PolitiFact is owned by the nonprofit Poynter Institute for Media Studies, and PolitiFact's editor-in-chief and executive director report to the Poynter president. PolitiFact had been owned by the Tampa Bay Times, but in 2018 direct ownership of PolitiFact was transferred from the Times to Poynter, which is the newspaper’s parent company. The move allows PolitiFact to function fully as a not-for-profit national news organization.”</p>

        <div class="subHeading2">
          <h3><a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/">Media Matters for America</a>:</h3>
        </div>
          <p class="indent">“Media Matters for America is a web-based, not-for-profit, 501 (c)(3) progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media. Media Matters for America put in place, for the first time, the means to systematically monitor a cross-section of print, broadcast, cable, radio, and Internet media outlets for conservative misinformation - news or commentary that is not accurate, reliable, or credible and that forwards the conservative agenda - every day, in real-time. Media Matters posts rapid-response items as well as longer research and analytic reports documenting conservative misinformation throughout the media. Additionally, Media Matters works daily to notify activists, journalists, pundits, and the general public about instances of misinformation, providing them with the resources to rebut false claims and to take direct action against offending media institutions.”</p>

        <div class="subHeading2">
          <h3><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a>:</h3>
        </div>
          <p class="indent">“[They] are a nonpartisan, nonprofit consumer advocate for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics. [They] monitor the factual accuracy of what is said by major U.S. political players in the form of TV ads, debates, speeches, interviews, and news releases. [Their] goal is to apply the best practices of both journalism and scholarship and to increase public knowledge and understanding. FactCheck.org is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The APPC was established by publisher and philanthropist Walter Annenberg to create a community of scholars within the University of Pennsylvania that would address public policy issues at the local, state, and federal levels.”</p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>:</h3>
        </div>
          <p class="indent">While Wikipedia is not a standard fact-checking site, it is a good resource as anyone can edit the information on it, meaning it is constantly being updated.  As information comes out or gets debunked, people are right on top of the changes and update the site. While this site shouldn’t be used alone for information, same with another site, it is a good starting point as to what you can gather to get a basic understanding of an event.</p>
          <p class="indent">“Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by acting as a widely accessible and free encyclopedia that contains information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely editable content whose articles also provide numerous links to guide readers to related pages with more information. Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers, anyone with Internet access and in good standing can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles (except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism).”</p>
